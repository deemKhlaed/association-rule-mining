# association-rule-mining

This notebook compares the performance and rule-generation capabilities of two popular
association rule mining algorithms: **Apriori** and **FP-Growth**.


Technologies Used
- Python (custom implementation)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Time module (for runtime comparison)

Features
- Implementation of both Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms from scratch
- Runtime tracking and side-by-side comparison
- Visualization of performance metrics and outputs
